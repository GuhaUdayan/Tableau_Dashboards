I thought of creating an animated visualization inspired from famous TED talk of "Hans Rosling". This is visualization is in reference to the geo-political situation prevalent in India nowadays. Topic to ponder visually is – how a conflict impacts a nation’s growth? Secondly how each country grew in the last 70 years w.r.t to India? Can we see this in an animated manner?

I plotted based on publicly available data of the entire world. Keeping the rest countries aside, I concentrated on the growth of India vs China post 1940’s where in a new world order started to take shape. I have also included Australia, Japan, Pakistan, Israel and USA as these are also part of current discourse. Rest of the historical data is excluded.

Each bubble here is size of a nation based on its population for that particular year. And it is plotted on two axes – namely GDP per capita vs Life expectancy in years. India’s is shown in blue bubble, China in red, Pak in green while, rest of countries are shown as palette in the right side.
