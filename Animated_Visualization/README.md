Here are few inferences that can be deduced whose sccreen prints are attached too-
1) Compared to other SAARC countries, Sri Lanka fared quite well in the late 19th century - "SriLanka_Late_19century"
2) Maldives was ahead of other SAARC countries in the end of 20th century - "Maldives_end_of_20th_century"
3) One can see the devastation in Germany post World War II - "Germany_after_WW2"
4) China clearly payed the price of Mao's decisions in the 1960's decade - "China_lagging_in_1960s"
5) Afganistan was better in a sense than other of its SAARC neighbours in "Afganistan_mid_20thCentury" and how it was devastated post being attacked by USA - "Afganistan_during_2001_due_to911"
